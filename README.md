This is the official tool for creating and animating blocks, items and entities for [Vintage Story](http://www.vintagestory.at/). It is based on on [MrCrayfish's Model Creator for Minecraft](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/ModelCreator) but extends upon it with many more features and saves the models in a format the vintage story engine can read.

Current featureset:
- Create/Remove/Modify/Arrange single cubes to build shapes
- Texture Mapping Mode, automatic texture reload
- Undo/Redo capability
- Keyframe editor to create animations
- Attachment point editor
- Auto UV Unwrap for individual boxes with several unwrap modes
- Export screenshots and animated gifs
